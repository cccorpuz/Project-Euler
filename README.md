# Project-Euler
The purpose of this repo is to store all of my solutions to Project-Euler problems as a show of my journey of applying mathematics to difficult applied problems. I am not a CS student, so conventions may not always be seen throughout the code. However, one of the goals of working on Project Euler is to learn more efficient programming conventions, both logically and computationally.

# Project-Euler
The purpose of this repo is to store all of my solutions to Project-Euler problems as a show of my journey of applying mathematics to difficult applied problems. I am not a CS student, so typical conventions in writing code may not always be present throughout. However, one of the goals of working on Project Euler is to learn more efficient programming conventions, both logically and computationally.
